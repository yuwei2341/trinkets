read_pdf.py
----------------
This module contains functions for processing PDF files converted from OneNote pages. 
OneNote pages generally contain a title followed by the date and time the page was created,
with content organized in bullet points. This module provides functionality to extract text 
from a given PDF document. The `pypdf` library is used for PDF reading and extraction.

Functions:
    - extract_information(pdf_path): Extracts textual information from the PDF file located at the 
      given path. Returns the extracted text as a DataFrame or raises an error if the PDF cannot be processed.

Dependencies:
    - pypdf: Required for reading and extracting content from PDF files.
    
Usage:
    - Import this module in other parts of the application where PDF processing is needed.
    - Example usage:
        from utils.read_pdf import extract_information
        extracted_text = extract_information('path/to/file.pdf')
